# WebAPP-Microservices-SpringBoot-Thymeleaf
This is a more complicated extended version of the JEE webApp. The different contents of the app are located in diferent files. If one crashes it doesn't affect the others.

I use the software Bootstrap to initialize the microservices separatly. Everything using Java and html.
